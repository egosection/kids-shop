## Kids-Shop website with HTML, CSS(tailwindcss) & JAVASCRIPT

- I tried to make a good design and is entirely mine.

- The website is built based on the requirements of AdvanceAcademy.

- JavaScript dynamics have been added, only the cart section needs improvements.

- I haven't created JavaScript files into different directories for each part of the site since it's a one-page website.

- Every image is optimized

- Friendly - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)
